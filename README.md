# Secure Note-Taking with WASM Sandboxing

A secure note-taking application that demonstrates sandboxed execution of user-submitted WebAssembly (WASM) plugins.

## Project Overview

This project implements a backend system for a secure note-taking application that can run user-submitted WASM plugins in a sandboxed environment. It's inspired by blockchain systems and smart contract runtimes, aiming to provide hands-on experience with WASM runtimes, sandboxing, and secure API design.

For a detailed project description, features, and requirements, please see [ProjectIntro.md](ProjectIntro.md).
